*"For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the LORD, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel."* Ezra 7:10

Ezra Project is a user-friendly Bible study tool focussing on topical study based on keywords/tags. This program can help you to easily manage your topical verse lists and verse-based notes. Ezra Project works with [SWORD Bible translation modules](http://www.crosswire.org/sword) and thus enables Bible study in many languages. It runs on Windows, macOS and Linux and the user interface has been localized to English, German, French and Dutch.
